          Once per 30 days, APY will be reduced by 10% from the previous month.
          This allows for the token to continue to maintain positive price
          action pressure while the PTX token rebases with a flexible supply.
          This will continue each month for 12 events, ending with a fixed .5%
          daily yield rate (rebasing every 30 minutes).
        </p>
        <p>
          What do we mean by this? While it is not a classical “halving” in the
          sense of daily yield being reduced by 50%, it is a means of reducing
          emissions rate over time in a structured and predictable means in
          order to maintain growth of the protocol.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Historically speaking, these types of emissions models to promote
          sustainability have inspired genuine growth in market cap and token
          price.
        </p>
        <p>
          Long-term sustainability and transparency is a priority for ProjectX.
          As reductions in increasing supply are implemented, the more the
          positive price action variables can push the token price action.
        </p>
        <p>
          While we are not BTC and certainly have different tokenomic variables,
          the economic theory of reducing minted token yield is sound and proven
          in finance.
